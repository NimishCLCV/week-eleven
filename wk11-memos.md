# Week 11 Memos – Data Publishing, Replication, Reproducibility
- I explored how the Archaeology Data Service (ADS) hosts datasets and used R to load, filter, and visualize archaeological data directly from their archives.
- I reproduced the example analysis using Campbell’s Glass dataset by filtering for specific artefact forms, counting frequencies, and generating barplots.
- I followed Hope Loiselle’s replication workflow for the Marwick paper and saw how different researchers can interpret the same dataset in slightly different ways.
- I saw how reproducibility lets us check whether interpretations hold up when someone else looks at the same data using transparent methods.
- I reflected on how excavation destroys the original context, which makes reproducibility even more important in archaeology than in many other fields.

## Rough Parts / Errors
- I struggled to understand how the ADS organizes large multi-file datasets, since some archives are hard to navigate.
- It was difficult to tell what counted as “good enough” documentation when trying to interpret someone else’s workflow.

## New Terms I Encountered
- Reproducibility 
- ADS (Archaeology Data Service)  
- Data Archive  

## Key Takeaways
- Reproducibility isn’t just about repeating results it’s about making research transparent and usable in the future.
- Archaeology especially needs reproducible data because excavation is destructive that is once something is dug, the documentation becomes the only evidence.
- Publishing data publicly connects archaeology and history to broader communities, including students, researchers, and the public.
- This week showed me that open data practices are not just technical and that they change who can participate in research and how knowledge is built.
