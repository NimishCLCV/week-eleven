# Journal – Week 11 (Data Publishing, Replication, Reproducibility)

**Quote from reading:**
“Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative.” (Marwick 2025, p. 6) 

**Reflection:**
I chose this quote because it directly connects to what I experienced when working through both the ADS exercise and the replication assignment. 
Once I started loading the ADS dataset and then revisiting Marwick’s lithics analysis, I understood how fragile research becomes when it isn’t reproducible. 
Even small things like broken URLs, unclear variable names, or missing documentation make it difficult to trust results without being able to re-run or check the process.
As a History student, this made me think about how rarely historians make their workflows visible. 
If historical arguments had to be reproducible, education would have to shift toward transparency, showing how sources were selected, what was excluded, and what interpretive choices shaped the final argument. 
That could have a huge impact on public facing history by making interpretations traceable rather than just persuasive.

**Challenges and Successes:**
- A challenge was understanding how ADS structures its datasets, since many archives include multiple folders and unclear file naming.
- A success was loading the dataset into R, filtering artefact forms, and generating barplots that matched what the example analysis described.
- A success was replicating Loiselle’s dorsal cortex comparison and seeing similar patterns to both her findings and Marwick’s.
- A challenge was interpreting the results, since comparing lithic proportions still required judgment.

**What This Means for Me as a History Student:**
- Reproducibility could make historical work more transparent, especially in public history.
- Making workflows visible would help explain how interpretations are built, not just what they conclude.
- Open data practices could let communities challenge or extend historical narratives instead of only receiving them.
- It showed me that both archaeology and history involve ethical responsibilities when sharing knowledge.

**Looking Ahead:**
Next time, I want to practice documenting my steps more clearly, so that someone else could follow my process.
